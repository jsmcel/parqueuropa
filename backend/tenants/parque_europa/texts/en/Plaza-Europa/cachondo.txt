Welcome to Plaza Europa, the "navel" of Parque Europa! This is the most European square you will ever see in your life. Here you have the flags of the twenty-seven countries of the European Union flying proudly, as if it were the hall of fame of the European Union.

Do you know what is the funniest thing? Here you can see the flag of Italy (pizza, pasta, mmm), that of Germany (sausages, cars), that of Spain (you see it every day, I don't need to point it out to you)... All together in perfect harmony! It's like having all of Europe in one place, but without having to wait in line at the airport.

In the center there is a very special fountain decorated with a map of Europe. It's like having the entire continent in the water! And on the floor there is a giant map where you can walk over the countries. It's like being a giant walking through Europe!

And do you know what is the most fun? That this is where all nationalities come together. You can listen to Spanish, English, French, German... It's like a Tower of Babel, but in a tourist version and without confusion. European efficiency to the maximum!

Plaza Europa is the perfect place to take a group photo with all the flags in the background. It's like having all of Europe in a single photo! Maximum photographic efficiency.

This place is surely less historical-artistic than the other monuments (not that in the 18th century there was already a European Union... or yes, maybe Napoleon tried by force, but it doesn't count). Here the vibe is more institutional, with little signs with curious data: number of countries (currently twenty-seven), year of foundation (1992 with Maastricht), anthem (Beethoven's Ode to Joy).

So enjoy this special square. It's the perfect place to realize that, hey, we have a small but well-connected continent. And without a passport!
