Plaza Europa constitutes the symbolic core of Parque Europa, functioning as a contemporary forum dedicated to the European Union. This circular plaza is an original creation of the park that does not replicate any existing location, but rather serves as a tribute to the European Union as a whole.

The design of the square incorporates fundamental symbolic elements: a central fountain decorated with a map of the European continent, and the flags of the twenty-seven member countries of the European Union fly around it. On the floor, a large map of Europe shows the silhouette of the countries, allowing visitors to walk on it locating countries and capitals, turning it into an interactive educational tool.

The perimeter of the square is decorated with national flags arranged according to European protocol. Seeing the French, German, Italian, Spanish, etc. tricolor together produces a visual effect of unity in diversity. It also flies the Flag of the European Union (blue with twelve golden stars), which represents the common European identity.

The square includes plaques with information about the European Union, its motto "United in Diversity" and data on the date of founding (Treaties of Rome, 1957; Maastricht, 1992). The set does not emulate any specific historical style; Rather, it is functional and modern, with clean pavement, metal flagpoles, and abstract sculptures.

From a symbolic point of view, Plaza Europa embodies the founding values ​​of the European Union: cultural diversity, peaceful coexistence and unity in difference. The square represents the culmination of centuries of European history, where flags that once fought wars today fly peacefully together.

The educational function of the square is fundamental: being the meeting point, it facilitates interaction between visitors of different nationalities, creating a microcosm of European diversity. The contrast with the fragment of the nearby Berlin Wall is intentional: that fragment remembers the division until 1989; This square celebrates integration from 1992 onwards.

Plaza Europa is not only a functional space, but a monument in itself that represents the idea of ​​Europe as a common project, where cultural diversity becomes shared wealth. It is a space that can host commemorative events, speeches, flag raising or musical performances in a pan-European context.
