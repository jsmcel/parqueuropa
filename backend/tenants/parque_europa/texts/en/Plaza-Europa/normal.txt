Welcome to Plaza Europa, the symbolic heart of Parque Europa. This circular plaza is an original creation of the park that does not replicate any existing location, but rather serves as a tribute to the European Union as a whole.

Europe Square has a central fountain decorated with a map of the European continent, and the flags of the twenty-seven member countries of the European Union fly around it. It is a large, open space, with no replicated buildings, rather a modern forum dedicated to the idea of ​​a united Europe.

On the floor, a large map of Europe shows the silhouette of the countries, allowing visitors to walk on it locating countries and capitals, turning it into an interactive educational tool. The perimeter of the square is decorated with national flags arranged according to European protocol.

It also flies the Flag of the European Union (blue with twelve golden stars), which represents the common European identity. There are plaques with information about the European Union, its motto "United in diversity" and information on the date of founding.

This square represents the culmination of centuries of European history, where flags that once fought wars today fly peacefully together. It is the perfect place to reflect on European values: democracy, human rights and cultural diversity.

Europa Square is the ideal starting point to understand the evolution of Europe from division to integration, offering a unique perspective of the unity in diversity that characterizes the European continent.
