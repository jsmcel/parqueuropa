Before us unfolds the majestic Fontana di Trevi, one of the most emblematic fountains in the world and symbol par excellence of Roman baroque. This replica transports us to the heart of Rome, where the original fountain, completed in 1762, represents the culmination of centuries of hydraulic and artistic tradition of the Eternal City.

Historical context: The Trevi Fountain was built on the end of the Aqua Virgo aqueduct, one of the eleven aqueducts that supplied ancient Rome. This aqueduct, built in the year nineteen BC by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, was the only one that continued to function throughout the Middle Ages, providing water to the city. The current fountain was designed by Nicola Salvi in ​​1732, during the papacy of Clement 12, and was completed in 1762 under the pontificate of Clement 13. Its construction marked the rebirth of baroque art in Rome after a period of relative decline.

Artistic analysis: The fountain is a late Baroque masterpiece, combining architecture, sculpture and landscaping in a unique theatrical composition. Its design integrates perfectly with the Poli palace, which acts as an architectural backdrop. The composition is organized around the central figure of Neptune (Ocean), god of the sea, who advances on a shell pulled by two tritons and sea horses. The mermen represent the states of the sea: one tames a restless horse (rough sea), while the other controls a calm horse (calm sea). This duality symbolizes the changing nature of the ocean.

Iconographic symbology: The fountain is full of mythological and allegorical symbols. The lateral figures represent Abundance (with horn of plenty) and Healthiness (with cup and snake), while the upper reliefs narrate the history of the Aqua Virgo aqueduct. Decorative elements include shells, corals, algae and other marine motifs that create an underwater atmosphere. Water, the central element, symbolizes life, purification and renewal.

Construction technique: the fountain is built of Roman travertine and marble, materials that give it its characteristic golden color. Its hydraulic system is a work of engineering: water flows from the aqueduct through a system of canals and waterfalls that create the characteristic sound and visual effect. The fountain consumes approximately eighty thousand cubic meters of water per day, which is continuously recycled.

Tradition and ritual: The Trevi Fountain is famous for the tradition of coin throwing. According to legend, throwing a coin with your right hand over your left shoulder guarantees your return to Rome. This tradition, popularized by the film "Three Coins in the Fountain" (1954), generates thousands of euros a day that go to charity. The fountain has appeared in numerous films, with Fellini's "La Dolce Vita" (1960) being the most iconic.

Value in the park: The presence of the Trevi Fountain in Parque Europa represents the classical and baroque heritage of Europe. It is a symbol of the continuity between ancient and modern Rome, of the dialogue between architecture and nature, and of art's ability to transform the utilitarian into the sublime. The replica allows us to appreciate the complexity of its composition and the mastery of its execution, inviting us to reflect on the importance of water in European civilization and on how art can elevate the everyday to the category of myth.
