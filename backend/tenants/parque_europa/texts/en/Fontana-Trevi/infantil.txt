Hello little explorers! Today we are going to visit the Fontana di Trevi, the most magical fountain in Rome!

Do you know where the Trevi Fountain really is? In Rome, Italy! But here in Parque Europa we have a copy so you can see it up close. It's like having Rome right here!

The Trevi Fountain is super special because it is very, very big. Imagine that it is almost twenty-six meters high! That's like putting eight houses on top of each other. How tall!

Who built it? A very intelligent man called Nicola Salvi! He was an architect, which is like being a very good builder of beautiful things. He made it a long time ago, in 1732, more than 290 years ago!

The fountain is dedicated to Neptune, the god of the sea. He has a chariot drawn by sea horses and mermen. It's like a fairy tale!

Do you know what? There is a super magical tradition! If you throw a coin over your left shoulder, you will return to Rome! Thousands of coins are released every day. It's like a magical treasure!

The Trevi Fountain appears in many films. The most famous is "La dolce vita"! He's like a movie star.

Would you like to flip a coin and make a wish? It's sure to happen!
