The Trevi Fountain is the largest and most famous monumental fountain in Rome, a masterpiece of Italian Baroque. It is located at the confluence of three streets (hence the name Trevi, from Tre Vie or "three ways") and marks the end point of the ancient Aqua Virgo aqueduct, built in nineteen BC by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa to supply water to the baths of imperial Rome. In fact, on the façade of the current fountain the legend of the young virgin who helped the Romans locate that source of pure water twenty-two kilometers from the city, the origin of the aqueduct, is represented.

After the fall of the Roman Empire, the aqueducts were left in ruins and Rome lost its fountains. Centuries later, in the middle of the Renaissance (15th century), Pope Nicholas V restored the Aqua Virgo in 1453 and ordered the construction of a simple commemorative fountain, designed by Leon Battista Alberti, to celebrate the arrival of clean water to the city again. Years later, Pope Urban VIII considered that modest fountain insufficient and in 1625 commissioned the artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini for a grander project. Bernini even changed the location of the fountain within the square to enhance its visibility, but the death of the pontiff stopped the work. It would not be until 1732 when Pope Clement XII called a competition that the architect Nicola Salvi won. Salvi began construction that same year and, after his death in 1751, the project was completed by Giuseppe Pannini in 1762.

The result is a spectacular fountain, almost twenty-six meters high and almost twenty meters wide, made mainly of travertine marble, which occupies the entire rear façade of the Poli Palace as a theatrical stage. The composition has a rich marine theme: in the center stands Neptune, god of the ocean, standing on a large shell drawn by two sea horses (one calm and the other rearing, symbolizing the serenity and fury of the sea) guided by tritons who tame the reins. On both sides of Neptune, in niches, are placed the allegorical figures of Abundance (pouring water from a cornucopia) and Healthiness (holding a medicinal cup), representing the prosperity and health that water provides. The complete scene, with the rocks, the plants and the torrent of water that falls into a large pool, creates the illusion of a sea cliff emerging in the heart of the city.

The Trevi Fountain not only stands out for its artistic grandeur but also for the traditions that surround it. The most famous custom is to throw a coin into the water to ensure the return to Rome. According to popular myth (born with the 1954 film "Three Coins in the Fountain"), throwing a coin with your back into the fountain guarantees that one day you will return to the Eternal City; two coins predict a romance with an Italian; and three coins promise marriage. These wishes have been so profound that every year around one million euros in coins are collected from the fund, money that the city council allocates to charity. Another curiosity is the small Fountain of Lovers, a discreet drinking fountain on the right side of the main fountain. Legend says that when a loving couple had to separate for a long time, they both drank together from their two spouts using the same glass, and then broke it. With this symbolic ritual they "made sure" to be faithful and meet again in the future.

The image of this fountain has been immortalized in popular culture, especially thanks to cinema. Who doesn't remember Anita Ekberg inviting Marcello Mastroianni to bathe with her in the Trevi Fountain during the famous scene from "La dolce vita" (1960)? That mix of art, water and romance under the stars turned the fountain into a symbol of the Roman dolce vita and increased its worldwide fame.

At Parque Europa, visitors can enjoy a replica of this legendary fountain built at approximately half the scale of the original. Even in reduced size, the park's Trevi Fountain retains its scenic beauty: Neptune, his horses and tritons welcome us among the noise of the water, transporting us for a moment to the magical atmosphere of Rome. And, of course, here it is also possible to fulfill the ritual: throw a coin into the water and make a wish, leaving a little piece of illusion that connects Torrejón de Ardoz with the Eternal City.
