The Brandenburg Gate is the most representative monument in Berlin and a symbol of recent European history. Inspired by the propylaea of ​​classical Athens, its form of a large portico with columns recalls the solemn entrances to ancient cities. Above the complex stands a chariot: a chariot pulled by four horses, guided by the figure of Victory.

At the end of the twentieth century, the gate was located next to the Berlin Wall, in a place that could not be crossed. So when the wall fell in 1989, thousands of people gathered there to celebrate reunification. Since then, the Brandenburg Gate represents openness, encounter and hope.

Its architecture is serene and balanced. When contemplating it, the repetition of columns and the play of lights and shadows created by the intercolumnia stand out. It is a monument that imposes itself without the need for decorative excesses, a legacy of a classicism that seeks harmony above all else.

In Parque Europa, the replica of the Brandenburg Gate brings to Madrid the image of that monumental Berlin square. It is a perfect corner to remember that cities change and heal, and that monuments, sometimes, become witnesses of the history that unites us.
