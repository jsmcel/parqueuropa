Carl Gotthard Langhans, the architect, decided that the city needed a welcome worthy of its ambitions: six Doric columns, an impeccable pediment and, if anything was missing, a chariot with the goddess Victoria leading four horses. That is, a door that is not satisfied with opening: it judges you a little as you pass.

For centuries, everything has happened here. Soldiers, demonstrations, tourists with selfie sticks and politicians with little time. The door, imperturbable, has been a backdrop for errors and successes. When the wall split Berlin in two, this door was left in no man's land, like a main actor without a stage. And the day the wall fell, he recovered his role without saying “I already told you so.” German elegance.

Look closely: it seems simple, but each proportion is measured to make you feel small and, at the same time, invited. It is architecture doing diplomacy: it doesn't shout at you, it convinces you. And it does it without neon lights.

Advice for use? Go underneath and think about everything these stones have seen. If you're in a hurry, at least take a look. Doors, like people, tell you more by how they are made than by what they say.
