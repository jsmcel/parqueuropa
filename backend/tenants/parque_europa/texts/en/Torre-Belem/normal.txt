The Belém Tower is one of the best-known postcards of Lisbon. Located next to the mouth of the Tagus River, it was born as part of the city's defensive system and soon also became a symbolic gateway to the ocean. Its elegant and compact silhouette combines strength with the delicacy of its decoration.

The building belongs to the Manueline style, a Portuguese variant of late Gothic that incorporates marine motifs: sculpted ropes, armillary spheres, shields and elements inspired by navigation. This ornamentation recalls the time of discovery, when Portuguese ships ventured towards new routes and worlds to discover.

From the shore, the tower seems to dialogue with the water. The battlements, balconies and trefoil windows create an unmistakable image, especially beautiful in the golden afternoon light. It is a monument that unites defense, beauty and memory of the sea.

In Parque Europa, the replica of the Belém Tower allows you to get closer to this Lisbon symbol without crossing borders. To observe it up close is to imagine unfurled sails, extended maps and the open horizon of great voyages. A small trip to Portugal in the heart of Torrejón de Ardoz.
