Hello little sea explorers! Today we are going to visit the Belém Tower, a very special monument that comes from Lisbon, the capital of Portugal.

Do you know what a tower is? It's like a very tall and narrow building. But this tower is very special because it is on the Tagus River, as if it were a floating tower!

The Belém Tower was built a long time ago, in 1515, more than five hundred years ago! It is very old, like your great-great-grandmother. It is made of limestone, which is a very resistant stone.

Do you know who made it? A very famous architect named Francisco de Arruda, who was Portuguese. He was very good at building pretty things!

The tower is shaped like a ship, as if it were a stone ship! It is very tall, about thirty meters tall, like a ten-story building. It has four small towers in the corners, like a castle!

Do you know what it was for? To protect Lisbon from the enemies that came by sea. He was like a river guardian! The soldiers could see from above if enemy ships were coming.

The Belém Tower is very famous because it represents the era of discoveries. The Portuguese were very good sailors and discovered many new countries. They were like sea explorers!

Do you know a curious thing? The tower has very beautiful decorations with stone ropes, as if it were a real ship. It's very detailed!

The Belém Tower teaches us that sometimes the highest things can be the most important. And it also reminds us that exploration and discovery are very valuable.
