At first glance it looks like a little sand castle that someone left on the edge of the Tagus, but made by an architect with a lot of pulse and zero plastic shovels. The Belém Tower is that perfect mix between a fortress and a jewel box: it has battlements to defend the city and, at the same time, balconies so charming that they make you want to look out with a cape and feather hat to greet the ships.

Imagine Lisbon in the sixteenth century: caravels leaving at dawn, maps with dragons drawn on them and sailors with more hair than shampoo. In this environment, Portugal marks this tower to guard the entrance to the port and, in the process, tell the world: “Be careful, here we are pro-sea.” And boy does it show. Look calmly at the decoration: sculpted ropes, armillary spheres, crosses and, attention, a rhinoceros carved into a gargoyle. Yes, you read that right: a rhinoceros. Because when you are the first European country to receive a real rhino, you celebrate by putting it in stone. Good marketing.

The tower plays both sides: if you were an enemy cannon, you would see a low, solid bastion pointing at the river; If you are a tourist with a camera, you see an elegant tower that looks like a Manueline cake (not to be confused with “manual”: the Manueline style is the Portuguese fashion of the time, very much for fine sailors). Between you and me, it is the typical construction that defends you in a city that decorates a postcard. Total multifunction.

Instagrammable details? By the handful. Trefoil windows perfect for “hello, Lisbon” with the wind in your hair. Balconies where you imagine a musician with a Portuguese guitar playing fados to the waves. Battlements with curious shapes that make your photo look like something out of a medieval video game but with an Atlantic filter. And if the sun falls obliquely, prepare for travel magazine shadows. The tower knows how to pose.

Geek fact to look great: the stone is local limestone (lioz, for the very serious), and the complex combines a polygonal bastion below with a taller tower above. Translation from geek to simple? Bottom part for “fire!” and the top part for “how cute I look from here.” All this seasoned with decorative whims of marine inspiration and some Moorish touch that feels luxurious. Iberian and global, like a good grilled cod.

And now, express trip to Torrejón: in Parque Europa you have the version for all audiences. You approach it, go around it, and even though the cannons don't rise or ship sirens sound, your brain goes into “Lisbon activated” mode. If you close your eyes a little, you might get a gust of breeze that tastes like pastel de nata. Not guaranteed, but not impossible if you've been to the cafeteria before.

Tips for use:
- Classic photo: from the front, with the river (or pond) next to it. Hand on forehead, gaze at the horizon of a sailor eager for adventure. Subtitle: “Heading to the Indies… or for a coffee.”
- Fetish detail: look for the rhinoceros. It's the “Where's Wally?” of the tower. When you find it, brag: “This is a world heritage site and, what's more, it has rhino.”
- Romantic moment: at sunset. The stone turns golden brown and the percentage of “oooh” per square meter increases.

In short: the Belém Tower is the architectural equivalent of a well-curated playlist. It has rhythm (defense), melody (decoration) and that catchy chorus that you hum without meaning to (the rhinoceros, again). Here, at Parque Europa, it makes you travel without a passport: a sip of Lisbon served in a stone glass. And yes, you are allowed to take as many photos as you want. Just try not to say “little castle”. He gets angry. A bit.
