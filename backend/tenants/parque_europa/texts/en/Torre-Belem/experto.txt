Historical context and function
The Belém Tower, built between 1514 and 1520 during the reign of Manuel the First, is part of the defensive system at the mouth of the Tagus River. Conceived as a work that was both military and representative, it guarded the maritime access to Lisbon and symbolized the Age of Discoveries, when Portugal opened routes to Africa, Asia and America. Its authorship is attributed to the master builder and engineer Francisco de Arruda, an expert in military architecture, with experience in plazas in North Africa. The complex was originally known as Torre de São Vicente, patron saint of Lisbon. Since 1983 it has been inscribed, together with the nearby Jerónimos Monastery, on the UNESCO World Heritage List for its exceptional value.

Implementation and materials
The tower was built on a rocky island near the north bank of the Tagus, practically inside the channel, which multiplied its effectiveness as a river “battery.” As the centuries passed, the modification of the course and the filling of the riverbank left it connected to the land. The main material is Lioz limestone, a local fine-grained stone highly valued in Lisbon for its resistance and its ability to be carved with detail. This quality explains the profuse sculptural decoration it presents, typical of the Manueline style.

Typology and spatial organization
The complex combines a low bastion with a polygonal plan (close to the hexagon) with a four-story prismatic tower that rises on the land side of the bastion. This arrangement superimposes two logics: below, the artillery platform close to the sheet of water, with large embrasures for low-fire pieces; Above, the surveillance and representation tower, with rooms, balconies, machicolations and projecting sentry boxes (bartizans) in the corners. The upper walkway and decks offer observation points and vertical defense. The interior chambers are covered with stone cross vaults, and the vertical communication is resolved by narrow stairs inserted in very thick walls, typical of a 16th century fortification.

Formal language: Manueline
The Belém Tower is a paradigm of the Manueline style, a late Gothic Portuguese language that incorporates nautical iconography and allusions to royal power and military orders. Sculptured ropes appear that “ring” columns and frames, armillary spheres (personal emblem of Manuel I), crosses of the Order of Christ, plant motifs and shells. There is no shortage of elements of Mudejar/Islamic flavor, visible in balconies with multi-lobed arches and in the bulbous domes of the sentry boxes. This coexistence of references (Gothic, Islamic, early Renaissance) is characteristic of Manueline, a style that makes the maritime and cultural openness of Portugal its reason for being.

Singular elements and symbology
- Artillery bastion: key piece of the defense, with gunboats that allowed crossfire at water level. Its polygonal shape minimizes blind angles and exposes oblique surfaces that are more resistant to impacts.
- Tower and balconies: the vertical body incorporates trefoil windows, machicolations and a north balcony famous for its tracery. These elements, of clear representative value, “make visible” the power of the monarchy to those who entered or left the port.
- Sentry boxes and domes: the bartizans in the corners, topped by hemispherical domes with pinnacles, combine function (watching and beating angles) and decorative refinement.
- Rhinoceros gargoyle: iconographic curiosity associated with the arrival in Lisbon, in 1515, of an Indian rhinoceros sent as a diplomatic present to King Manuel the First. Its size summarizes the climate of fascination with the exotic typical of overseas expansion.

Evolution and uses
Although conceived as an artillery fort, the tower underwent adaptations. After the earthquake of 1755, which affected much of Lisbon, the structure survived with repairable damage. In later stages it served as a customs checkpoint and, temporarily, as a prison. It was the subject of restorations in the 19th and 20th centuries that consolidated factories, cleaned the stone and restored lost elements, all with criteria that were gradually more respectful of material authenticity. The heritage resignification, especially from romanticism, transformed its reading: from a military machine to an identity emblem and cultural attraction.

Technical and aesthetic reading
Belém illustrates the transition between medieval towers and modern artillery. The lowering of the shooting platforms to levels close to the water, the width of the embrasures and the faceted geometry respond to ballistics and control of the navigable channel. However, the exuberance of the finish turns the fortification into “representative architecture.” This double code (military effectiveness + symbolic ornament) explains its popularity: it is, at the same time, machine and monument. Lioz limestone also ages with a patina that enhances volumes and shadows, hence its special photogenicity at sunset.

Belém in Europa Park
The replica in Parque Europa condenses these features on an accessible scale. For an informed reading, note:
- Bastion/tower relationship: the low and solid base in front of the decorated vertical body.
- Manueline motifs: ropes, armillary spheres and crosses; Its identification favors the connection with the Portuguese context of the beginning of the sixteenth century.
- Sentry boxes and balconies: their visual control function and their ceremonial value.
Along the route of the park, Belém dialogues with other pieces from the era of exploration and with works of different chronology (Puerta de Alcalá, Eiffel Tower), underlining how European identity is woven between defense, commerce, science and art.

Comparative note
In front of Italian Renaissance fortresses with a “modern” bastioned layout, the Belém Tower preserves the verticality and image of a medieval tower, but incorporates artillery solutions typical of its time. Its closest peer in Lisbon is the neighboring Torre de São Sebastião da Caparica (Old Tower), with which it formed a cross defense of the Tagus. Internationally, it is related to other port landmarks that are both defense and symbolic gate, such as the Castillo del Morro in Havana (already from the late sixteenth century) or the Torre de San Vicente in Cascais.

Conclusion
The Belém Tower synthesizes in stone the Atlantic vocation of Portugal: a fortress that guards the city and an emblem that proclaims openness to the world. Its presence in Parque Europa, although on a reduced scale, preserves the essential lesson: architecture can be at the same time technique, memory and beauty.
