The theaters of ancient Greece are extraordinary examples of architecture at the service of the arts. Built outdoors, usually on hillsides, they combined a large audience with surprising acoustics. The one in Epidaurus, perhaps the most famous, is famous for allowing you to hear clearly even from the highest stands.

The semicircular shape of the cavea (the stands), the orchestra circle where the choir performed and the skené (the stage background) were integrated into a harmonious whole. Nothing was coincidental: the choice of place, orientation and proportions sought to ensure that the voice traveled cleanly and that all spectators had a good view of the stage.

More than just a building, the theater was a meeting point for the community. There, tragedies and comedies were performed that reflected on destiny, justice, power and everyday life. It was culture, but also coexistence and celebration.

In Parque Europa, this Greek theater evokes those spaces where the Western theatrical tradition was born. Sitting in its stands and looking at the scene invites you to imagine masks, choirs and ancient stories that still move today. It is an ideal place to understand how architecture can amplify the word and turn it into a shared experience.
