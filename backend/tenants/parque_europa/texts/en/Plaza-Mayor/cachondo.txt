This square is like the living room of Madrid, but without a sofa and with more terraces. There are arches that you will feel important when you pass, balconies that beg for selfies and, in the center, a king on horseback making sure you don't leave without a photo.

Here people have always come to buy, celebrate and gossip, that never fails. At Parque Europa we have the “pocket” version: same traditional air, fewer kilometers. If you suddenly get a craving for a calamari sandwich, don't worry, it's a normal side effect of the Plaza Mayor.

Pro tip: walk under the arcades with a face like “I summer here”, go out into the sun for the photo and finish by saying “how beautiful Madrid is!” even if you are in Torrejón. It always works.
