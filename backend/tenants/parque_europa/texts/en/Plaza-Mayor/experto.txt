Comparisons: We can compare this set with other samples of representative architecture. As we mentioned, the Poble Espanyol in Barcelona (1929) is a direct antecedent: one hundred and seventeen full-scale buildings representing towns from different Spanish regions were built there, creating a kind of ideal Spanish town. The Plaza de España in Torrejón is more compact, but conceptually similar. It can also be compared with the Plaza de España in Seville (1929): that semicircular square had on its sidewalk forty-eight boxes with world maps and benches representing each Spanish province. It was a regionalist display integrated into a large monument. Here, similarly, regional representations are integrated into a total monument. On a European level, this fictional plaza is similar to the idea of ​​a Euro Epcot: just as at Disney Epcot there are pavilions of countries, here there are facades of regions. However, since it is not a country but regions of one, it achieves greater stylistic coherence (they all share a certain underlying Spanish air).
