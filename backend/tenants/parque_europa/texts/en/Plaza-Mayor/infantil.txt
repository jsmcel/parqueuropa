Imagine a large plaza, like an outdoor living room. Around there are buildings with arches where people walk in the shade and have a drink on the terraces. In the center, a king on horseback watches everything from his statue.

This is the Plaza Mayor, a very famous place in Madrid. Many things have happened here: markets, parties and meetings between neighbors. It is a place to walk slowly, look at the balconies and listen to the murmur of the people.

In Parque Europa you have a recreation to feel that atmosphere without traveling. Look at the arches, the open space and how it invites you to play “being in Madrid”. If you imagine a calamari sandwich and a chocolate with churros, you're almost there.
