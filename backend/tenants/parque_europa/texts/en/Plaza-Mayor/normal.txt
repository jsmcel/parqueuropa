The Plaza Mayor is one of the most emblematic urban spaces in Madrid. Rectangular in plan and surrounded by porticoed buildings, it has been the scene of markets, celebrations, shows and citizen meetings for centuries. Its uniform facades, access arches and large central space create a very characteristic feeling of order and elegance.

On its perimeter there are arcades and balconies, and the Bakery House stands out with its paintings on the façade. In the center, the equestrian statue of Philip III recalls the historical past of the square and the public life it has always hosted. Over time, this place has been the heart of popular festivals and a meeting point for Madrid residents and visitors.

The Plaza Mayor is more than a monument: it is an open-air lounge, a living room of the city. Walking through it, sitting on a terrace or crossing it under the arches is an everyday experience that connects with history while remaining very current.

In Parque Europa, the recreation of the Plaza Mayor proposes a walk through that classic Madrid. It invites you to imagine the bustle of the ancient markets and the animation of the holidays. It is a perfect corner to stop, look around and enjoy the serenity of an urban space designed for coexistence.
