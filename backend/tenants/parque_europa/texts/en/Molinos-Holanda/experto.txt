These windmills transport us to the Kinderdijk polders, in the Netherlands, where they stand as witnesses of medieval hydraulic engineering and symbols of man's constant struggle against the sea. The Kinderdijk mills, built between 1738 and 1740, represent the culmination of an ancient tradition of water management that has allowed the Dutch to reclaim land from the sea.

Historical context: The Netherlands has been in constant struggle against the sea since the Middle Ages. Windmills were not only used to grind grain, but were essential for the drainage of polders (land reclaimed from the sea). Kinderdijk, located at the confluence of the Lek and Noord rivers, is a perfect example of this hydraulic engineering. The nineteen surviving mills form a drainage system that has operated for centuries, pumping water from the polders into the main rivers.

Technical analysis: Kinderdijk mills are of the "wipmolen" (pump mill) type, designed specifically for drainage. Its mechanism consists of a paddle wheel that, driven by the wind, pumps water from the lower channels to the upper ones. Each mill can pump up to about sixty thousand liters of water per minute with a favorable wind. The system works in cascade: the mills in the first row pump water into intermediate canals, and those in the second row lift it to the main rivers.

Architecture and operation: the windmills have a wooden structure with an octagonal base and a rotating cap that allows the blades to be oriented according to the direction of the wind. Its aerodynamic design maximizes the capture of wind energy. The interior housed the pumping machinery and, in some cases, the home of the miller and his family. Life in these mills was hard, requiring constant attention twenty-four hours a day.

Cultural symbology: Windmills are symbols of Dutch identity and the constant fight against the elements. They represent the perseverance, ingenuity and adaptability of the Dutch people. They are also symbols of community cooperation, since drainage required the coordination of multiple mills working together.

World Heritage Site: In 1997, Kinderdijk was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, recognizing its exceptional value as a testimony to medieval hydraulic engineering and its importance in the development of the Netherlands. The site includes not only the mills, but also the system of canals, dams and pumping stations that make up a unique cultural landscape.

Technological evolution: Although traditional windmills have been replaced by electric pumping stations, some continue to function as a backup to the modern system. This coexistence between traditional and modern technology is an example of sustainability and respect for heritage.

Value in the park: The presence of the Dutch mills in Parque Europa represents the heritage of European hydraulic engineering and the importance of water in the configuration of the continent. They are a reminder of how man has been able to adapt to the environment and the importance of community cooperation for the common good. The mills invite us to reflect on sustainability and respect for the environment, fundamental values ​​in today's Europe.

The windmills of Kinderdijk teach us that technology can be beautiful and functional at the same time, and that cultural heritage can coexist with modernity. Its presence in the park is a tribute to European ingenuity and the ability of people to work together to build a sustainable future.
