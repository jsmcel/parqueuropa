Hello little wind explorers! 🌬️ Today we are going to get to know the Dutch Windmills of Kinderdijk, some very special windmills that come from the Netherlands, a country in northern Europe. 🇳🇱

Do you know what windmills are? They are like big fans that use the power of the wind to do useful things. It's like having an invisible friend who is always blowing! 💨

Kinderdijk mills are very special because they not only grind flour, they also pump water! The Dutch use them to keep their land dry, because in the Netherlands there is a lot of water and sometimes everything floods. It's like having a giant vacuum cleaner for water! 💧

Do you know why they are so important? Because without these mills, half of Holland would be under water. The Dutch have gained ground from the sea thanks to them! It's as if they were heroes fighting against water. 🦸‍♂️

Windmills have large blades that rotate with the wind. When it blows hard, the blades spin very fast and pump a lot of water. It's like a giant fan but in reverse! Instead of moving air, they move water. 🌊

Do you know a curious thing? The windmills have a cap that can rotate to orient the blades according to the direction of the wind. It's like they have a hat that moves by itself! 🎩

In Kinderdijk there are nineteen windmills in a row, all working together to keep the land dry. It's like a team of water superheroes! Each mill can pump up to about sixty thousand liters of water per minute. That's a lot of water! 💦

The windmills are very tall and made of wood. They have stairs inside so that the miller can go up to fix the blades. Imagine climbing such a high staircase! 🪜

Would you like to see how the blades rotate? It's very relaxing! The sound of the wind and the movement of the blades is like a song of nature. 🎵

Dutch windmills teach us that we can use the power of nature to do useful things. And they also remind us that by working together we can achieve incredible things. Unity is strength! 💪

So enjoy looking at these very special windmills. Maybe it will inspire you to learn more about wind and water, and to work as a team to take care of our planet. Nature is very wise! 🌍
