Windmills are one of the most characteristic landscapes in the Netherlands. For centuries, these constructions have been used to grind grain and, above all, to move water in a land that lives in permanent dialogue with the sea. In places like Kinderdijk, a row of mills line the canals, silent witnesses of the Dutch struggle to reclaim land from the water.

Its operation is simple and brilliant: the blades capture the force of the wind and transmit it to an axis that moves gears and wheels. This movement is used for practical tasks, such as pumping water from polders to higher levels, keeping fields and towns dry. Thanks to this ingenuity, the Dutch landscape could be organized and cultivated.

From afar, the mills look like moving sculptures. Each turn of the blades marks a serene rhythm, and the reflection in the channels creates a picture that has inspired painters and photographers. They are humble constructions, made of wood and brick, but at the same time deeply sophisticated in their purpose.

In Parque Europa, the presence of the mills evokes the calm of the northern canals and the practical intelligence of traditional engineering. Walking alongside them invites you to imagine the wind blowing constantly and the soft sound of machinery in motion. It is a simple way to travel, without leaving Madrid, to a landscape that we all recognize as “very Dutch”.
