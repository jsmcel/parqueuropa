The Little Mermaid (Den lille havfrue in Danish) is a famous bronze statue that rests on a rock in the harbor of Copenhagen, Denmark. Despite its small size (it measures just over a meter in height), it has become the most recognized symbol of the city and one of the tourist icons of all of Denmark. The sculpture represents the protagonist of the famous fairy tale "The Little Mermaid" written in 1837 by Hans Christian Andersen: a young mermaid who, according to the story, gives up her life under the sea and her voice in exchange for obtaining human legs and thus being able to love a human prince, although her fate in the original story is tragic and moving.

The statue was commissioned in 1909 by brewing entrepreneur Carl Jacobsen, son of the founder of Carlsberg beer, who was fascinated after witnessing a ballet based on Andersen's story. Jacobsen wanted to donate a sculpture to the city that paid tribute to that very Danish history. The chosen sculptor was Edvard Eriksen, who worked on the figure taking the dancer Ellen Price (star of the Royal Danish Ballet who played the mermaid in the ballet) as inspiration. Ellen Price agreed to serve as a model for the head and face, but, out of modesty, declined to pose nude for the body. Finally, Eriksen used his own wife, Eline Eriksen, as the model for the mermaid's body. After being cast in bronze, the statue was inaugurated on August 23, 1933 and placed in the position it occupies today, on rocks at the water's edge in the Langelinie area, facing the Baltic Sea. The image of the young mermaid seated, with her tail transforming into human legs and with her gaze lost towards the horizon, perfectly captures the nostalgia and melancholy of Andersen's character, who longs for the impossible.

Since its installation, The Little Mermaid has become a must-see attraction for visitors from around the world. Millions of tourists come every year to see it up close and photograph it, often surprised by its modest dimensions but delighted by its expressiveness. Precisely because it is such a beloved symbol (and perhaps because of its physical vulnerability), the statue has also suffered numerous acts of vandalism over the decades. It has lost its head twice at the hands of vandals (in 1964 and 1998), making it necessary to sculpt or replace new pieces; It also had an arm amputated on another occasion (1984) and in 2003 it was torn from its rock by explosives and thrown into the water, to the disbelief of the Danes. Likewise, she has been painted with various colors and political messages in protests, or dressed in t-shirts and accessories clandestinely. Each time, the authorities have diligently restored it, demonstrating the deep sentimental value that The Little Mermaid has for the inhabitants of Copenhagen.

As an ambassador of Danish culture, the statue even traveled abroad: in 2010 it was temporarily moved to Shanghai, China, to be displayed in the Danish pavilion during that year's World Expo. It was the first time in almost a century that The Little Mermaid left her harborside rock; for six months, visitors to the Exhibition were able to admire it in person, while in Copenhagen its absence left a symbolic void (partially filled with a screen transmitting live images of the statue in China). After the Exhibition, the mermaid returned to her home in Copenhagen harbor and continues there, sitting patiently and stoically enduring the sea wind and the curiosity of her admirers.

At Parque Europa, visitors can find an exact life-size replica of this iconic Little Mermaid. Located next to the park's pond, the small sculpture surprises with its delicacy and fidelity to the original, allowing you to closely appreciate the details of the mermaid's pensive face and her scaly tail turned into legs. This Madrid version of The Little Mermaid transports us with our imagination to the cold Baltic Sea and the universe of Andersen's stories, adding a touch of magic and Scandinavian nostalgia to the journey. Although the sea that surrounds her here is just a calm pond, the essence of the Little Mermaid – that mix of longing, beauty and romantic sadness – remains intact, enchanting all who stop for a moment to contemplate her.
