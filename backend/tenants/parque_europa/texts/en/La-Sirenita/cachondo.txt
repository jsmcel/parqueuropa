From the cold waters of the Danish Baltic comes… tachan! The Little Mermaid of Copenhagen, in its version that does not catch colds in Torrejón. This little sculpture is world famous for being cute, small and a bit sad. In the original, which has been lying on a rock in the port of Copenhagen since 1913, the poor mermaid looks at the horizon waiting for her prince who doesn't even show up (come on, the crush that leaves you unnoticed).

The real statue was sculpted by Edvard Eriksen, inspired by the story by Hans Christian Andersen. Yes, that original story where the mermaid doesn't sing "Under the Sea" with partying crabs, but rather has a terrible time for love (Andersen was a bit emo, things as they are). The Little Mermaid is tiny: just over a meter high, not a giant sculpture. In fact, many tourists are surprised: "But is there a dwarf on the rock? I thought it would be like the aquatic version of the Statue of Liberty." Well no, friends, it's discreet. Quality > size, you know.

And what if the poor thing has suffered. She's lost her mind a couple of times (literally, vandals decapitating her like "I didn't like the Disney movie"), she's been defaced, she's even been pushed into the water. But the bronze girl always returns, restored and patient. If that's not resilience, let Poseidon come down and see. She is like the protagonist of a soap opera: everything happens to her and she remains firm waiting for that impossible love.

At Parque Europa we can see it without taking a plane to Denmark or risking a group of tourists sneaking into the photo. It is quiet, without annoying seagulls. Don't throw bread at him, he's not a duck; It doesn't do anything if you sing "Bajo del mar" to it, I already tried it and it doesn't matter. Better take the opportunity to tell your story: that if you gave up your voice for legs (total mistake of youth), that Andersen didn't give it a Disney ending but drama. Come on, ideal for children to learn that in real life sometimes the prince doesn't know anything.

A cultural curiosity: in Copenhagen the Little Mermaid is such a symbol that they have it on all the postcards, but many locals see it and say "meh, that's annoying again" because there are always tourists climbing the rock. Here we have it without tourist burdens. Enjoy it, take a selfie making a melancholic face next to it, as if thinking "oh, what will become of me in the human world...". And be thankful that in Torrejón it is not as cold as the Baltic, that the original remains like a mermaid pole in winter.

The Little Mermaid, a song to nostalgia, impossible love and patience... a lot of patience. Treat her well, the poor thing has endured enough. And who knows, maybe your Trevi coin from before will take effect and this little mermaid will finally find her prince (a Nemo from Madrid, perhaps?).
