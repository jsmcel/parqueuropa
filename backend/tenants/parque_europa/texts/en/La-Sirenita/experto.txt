This delicate bronze sculpture transports us to the shores of the Danish Baltic, where the Little Mermaid of Copenhagen stands as one of the most recognizable symbols of Denmark. Created by sculptor Edvard Eriksen in 1913, this work, just over a meter high, has become a global icon that transcends its modest size.

Historical context: The statue was commissioned by Carl Jacobsen, son of the founder of the Carlsberg brewery, after being fascinated by the ballet "The Little Mermaid" based on the story by Hans Christian Andersen. Sculptor Eriksen used his wife, Eline Eriksen, as a model for the face, while dancer Ellen Price posed for the body. The work was installed in the port of Copenhagen on August 23, 1933, immediately becoming a symbol of the city.

Artistic analysis: The sculpture represents the climax of Andersen's story, when the little mermaid contemplates the horizon from her rock, in a pose that combines melancholy and hope. The work shows a naked young woman sitting on a rock, with her legs transformed into a fish tail. His serene expression and contemplative posture capture the essence of the literary character: the search for impossible love and the acceptance of destiny.

Cultural symbology: The Little Mermaid embodies multiple meanings in Danish culture. On the one hand, it represents Denmark's connection to the sea (the country has more than seven thousand kilometers of coastline). On the other hand, it symbolizes the Danish literary tradition through Hans Christian Andersen, one of the country's most important writers. The statue also evokes the duality between two worlds: the marine and the terrestrial, the fantastic and the real.

History of the work: Throughout its existence, the Little Mermaid has suffered numerous acts of vandalism. She has been decapitated several times, painted, covered in ink, and even pushed into water. Each time, the city has restored it, demonstrating its importance as a symbol of national identity. During World War II, it was covered to protect it from German bombing.

Cultural influence: The Little Mermaid has transcended its Danish origin to become a universal symbol. It has inspired numerous film adaptations, with the Disney version being the best known. However, the original statue maintains the melancholy and depth of Andersen's story, moving away from the happy ending of the commercial versions.

Value in the park: The presence of the Little Mermaid in Parque Europa represents the literary and artistic heritage of Denmark, a country that has contributed significantly to European culture through its writers, designers and artists. The replica invites us to reflect on the power of literature to create universal symbols and on the importance of preserving cultural traditions. Furthermore, it represents Europe's connection with the sea, a fundamental element in the history of the continent.

The Little Mermaid reminds us that beauty can be found in simplicity and that the most powerful symbols are often the smallest. Its presence in the park is a tribute to the ability of art to transcend borders and become universal heritage.
