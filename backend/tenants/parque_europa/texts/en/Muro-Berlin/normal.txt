The Berlin Wall was, for almost three decades, the most visible symbol of the division of Europe into two blocs. Built in 1961, it separated families, neighborhoods and destinies, becoming a physical border that crossed the city. While one side was filled with graffiti and protest messages, the other showed the strict face of surveillance.

Beyond the concrete and the wire, the wall represented a time of tensions and fears. Escape attempts, stories of courage and also tragedy were forever associated with his name. When it fell in 1989, its demolition was celebrated throughout the world as the beginning of a new era of freedom and reunion.

Today, some original fragments are preserved as a reminder and place of memory. Colors, slogans and traces of time can still be read on its surfaces. They are pieces that speak of a city that knew how to put itself back together and of a Europe that chose unity over separation.

In Parque Europa, the replica of the Berlin Wall invites you to stop and reflect. In front of her, it is easy to imagine what it meant to live divided by a line. The set proposes a brief trip to the recent past, to value the importance of bridges, meetings and coexistence.
