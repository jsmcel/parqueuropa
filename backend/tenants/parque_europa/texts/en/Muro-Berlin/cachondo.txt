Little joke with this one: the Berlin Wall is pure history, but hard history. In Parque Europa they have recreated a section to give you an idea of ​​what that was like: a city, Berlin, divided in two by a huge concrete wall from 1961 to 1989. Imagine building a wall in the middle of Madrid that separated Malasaña from Chueca – well in Berlin they really did it, separating families, friends, lives. A drama that not even Netflix does in its most tragic historical series.

The original wall was more than three meters high and about 155 kilometers long, surrounding West Berlin as if it were an island in the middle of the communist GDR. It was anything but glamorous: barbed wire, guard towers, mean-spirited armed guards, and an indoor "death strip" with sand, anti-vehicle trenches, and guard dogs. Come on, it wasn't your garden wall exactly. They built it in the middle of the Cold War so that East Berliners would not escape to the West side. And boy did it cut the mustard: for twenty-eight years, Berlin was full of walls, graffiti (on the west side, urban artists expanded) and international tension.

But November of '89 arrived and bam! people got fed up. They began to knock down the wall with sledgehammers, to cross to the other side, to hug strangers. A historic street party with champagne, Trabants (the little cars of the East) beeping and David Hasselhoff singing "Looking for Freedom" on top of the wall – the latter really happened, the Hoff scored a mythical playback on New Year's Eve of '89 with a jacket with lights and everything. If that's not kitsch, let Marx go down and see it.

In Parque Europa, obviously, we don't have Hasselhoff or border guards shouting "Halt!" at you. What there is is a piece of wall so you can take photos and possibly paint something on it (will there be tourist graffiti?). They may have reproduced a famous mural such as the one with the kiss between Brezhnev and Honecker (the legendary communist kiss) or the one with the Trabant crossing the wall. Not bad for your stories: "Look, mom, tearing down the Berlin Wall... really bad."

The lesson here is serious but can be taken with dark humor: "This is the only monument that people celebrated by tearing themselves apart." And it's true, few people want to preserve walls that divide. That is why today in Berlin there are loose fragments as a memorial, and in Torrejón you have yours to reflect on.

Can you imagine the conversation between two neighbors separated by the wall? "Shall we meet for a beer?" – "Oh no, I have a wall at my door, better tomorrow if the regime falls." Plot twist: in the end he fell. And we, decades later, walk freely from one place to another like someone changing neighborhoods.

So go ahead, touch the wall, feel that vibe of they won't pass... well, now they did pass. And if you go with colleagues, recreate the scene: one acts as a serious guard, another as a spy crossing. Or just realize how lucky you are that this is just an attraction and not a suffocating reality. The Berlin Wall in Parque Europa: so that history is not forgotten... but without bad vibes, you still have an ice cream cart next door. And that is already victory.
