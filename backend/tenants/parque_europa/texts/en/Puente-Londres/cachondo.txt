Van Gogh Bridge (Arles, France)
See that simple wooden bridge, shaped like an open scissor? It is Van Gogh's Bridge, so called because the famous painter Vincent van Gogh painted it in one of his paintings. Its original name is the Langlois Bridge, and it is in Arles, in the south of France. Here they have recreated it so that you can learn about this part of art history.
Vincent van Gogh was a very important Dutch painter who lived in the nineteenth century. He painted very colorful paintings (you probably know "The Sunflowers" or "The Starry Night"). For a time he lived in Arles (France), and he liked to walk through the countryside. One day he saw a wooden drawbridge over a canal, with laundresses (women washing clothes) below, and he thought it was so picturesque that he painted it several times. Those paintings became famous. Since then, that bridge has been associated with him, which is why it was nicknamed "Van Gogh's Bridge."
The bridge itself is a small drawbridge. What does draw mean? Which can be raised to let ships pass. This is different from Tower Bridge, because it is smaller and more manual. Basically it has two beams above connected by cables to the moving part of the bridge. When you want to raise it, you pull some counterweights and the central platform rises, leaving it as an inverted "V". When the little boat passes, you lower it again and the two sides of the road reconnect.
These bridges were common on irrigation canals in Van Gogh's time (circa 1888). Today in Arles they have restored one to look like the one in the paintings, and people go to see it. Here at Parque Europa, they have brought it to give a calm and artistic atmosphere.
Pay attention: it is generally made of dark wood (or painted white, depending on the version), with black hardware. It has a part on dry land and the mobile part in the middle. On the sides there are usually wooden trestles that support the beams when it is open.
Van Gogh painted the bridge with a lot of color: intense blue sky, yellow earth, reflective water... Imagine that Provençal landscape. Maybe they have put some vegetation around it to simulate it.
Why is it interesting for children? First, because it is a different bridge, not so big or made of stone, but rural and simple. You can understand how a simple mechanism allowed farmers and boatmen to share roads and canals. Second, because it connects us with art: you can see a reproduction of Van Gogh's painting on a panel (sometimes these sites put an image of the painting). Look for it, see if you can find it. And if not, you can look it up at home later: "Langlois Bridge" by Van Gogh. You will see how beautiful.
You can pretend to be Van Gogh: make yourself draw or paint the bridge in the air or in a notebook. What colors would you use? Surely the sky of Torrejón is not so Provençal blue, but oh well. And ask your parents who Van Gogh was, maybe they will tell you curious things (like that he cut off his ear due to emotional problems... a little strange, yes).
You can also learn what Arles is: a French city with lots of sunlight, which inspired the painter.
This bridge teaches us that beauty is in everyday things. A bridge for people and boats to pass, we see it every day and it does not surprise us. But an artist sees it and can turn it into something magical on a canvas.
So, if you want, cross it slowly, imagining that a river with ducks passes below. Wave at the "imaginary ships" and say "Bridge up!" Of course, it's not going to move here, it's just a replica. But your fantasy is powerful.
Van Gogh Bridge: small, simple, but immortalized in art. Who knows, maybe when you grow up you will draw something everyday and make it famous too. Get inspired by this quiet corner of the park!
