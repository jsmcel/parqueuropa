Popularly known as “London Bridge”, this monument recreates the famous Tower Bridge, one of the most photographed icons of the British capital. Its image, with two towers linked by walkways and a board that can be raised, is part of the landscape of the River Thames and the memory of travelers from all over the world.

Tower Bridge was built at the end of the 19th century to allow large ships to pass through the docks of the Port of London. Its design combines metal structure with neo-Gothic stone details, uniting functionality and monumental image. The bridge's tilting mechanism, which opens the deck into two leaves, was an ingenious solution to avoid interrupting navigation.

From the walk, the towers look like guardians of the river. The mix of cables, finials and arches creates an unmistakable profile, especially beautiful at sunset when the light reflects off the water. It is a work designed for the practical life of the city, but also designed to amaze.

In Parque Europa, the reproduction of London Bridge allows you to imagine the sound of ship sirens and the activity of the port. It is a perfect place to pause, look through its railings and travel with your imagination to the banks of the Thames. A simple way to be, for a moment, in London without leaving Madrid.
