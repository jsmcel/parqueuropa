Attention little sailors! Here we have a Viking Ship. Do you know who the Vikings were? They were people who lived more than a thousand years ago in northern Europe, in countries like Norway, Sweden and Denmark. They loved sailing the sea in boats like this.

The Viking Ship you see is long, narrow and made of wood. Look at the front: it has a carved dragon head. What an impression! The Vikings put figures of dragons or other animals on their ships to scare their enemies (and maybe to bring luck too!). That's why they are sometimes called "sea dragons."

These ships are called longships or longships. Why were they so long? Because that way they went very fast through the water. They could navigate both in the sea and in rivers, because they did not need very deep water. They could get very close to the coast without running aground!

How did they move? They had large cloth sails to take advantage of the wind, and also many oars handled by the Vikings when there was no wind. Imagine thirty or forty strong men rowing at the same time, wow, what strength! With or without wind, the ship could move forward. That is why the Vikings traveled to distant places: they went to England, France, the Mediterranean and even America (long before Christopher Columbus). They were very good sailors and adventurers.

Inside the ship there were no comfortable cabins. The Vikings traveled outdoors (outdoors!), enduring the rain and cold. They carried food, water and their basic belongings. And why did they travel so much? Sometimes to trade (exchange things), sometimes to explore new lands and, yes, sometimes to attack towns and take treasure. They were warriors, but also farmers when they were at home.

This Viking Ship in Europa Park is a reproduction; It hasn't really sailed through the sea (don't worry, it won't suddenly move). But it is made with great detail: you can see the wooden planks joined together (this technique is called clinker, overlapping slats, very typical Viking), the round shields perhaps placed on the sides, and of course the large square sail (it is usually drawn with red and white stripes in many drawings).

Can you imagine being a Viking? You could shout "On an adventure!" in some made-up language, get on (only if it's allowed, that is) and pretend to row. Think about the sound of the waves and the wind filling the sail. How exciting!

Also look at the size: it is not a huge ship like a modern cruise ship. It was relatively small by our standards, but very sturdy. Thanks to its shape, it could surf big waves without breaking. And if they needed to transport it over land for a distance, they could do it with rollers and strong people (although it cost a lot of effort!).

In short, this Viking Ship shows us how the Vikings traveled many centuries ago. Without engines, without modern compasses… with cunning and courage! You can tell your parents that the Vikings reached Spain too, they even sailed down rivers to Seville in ancient times. They were tireless.

So, little Viking, enjoy looking at the details of this ship. Maybe you'll read or watch Viking stories later. They are great adventures. And whenever you see a wooden ship, you'll remember: "Ah, like the Viking Ship in Europa Park, ready for action on the high seas!"
