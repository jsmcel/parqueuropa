Viking ships, popularly known as longships, were light, fast and very resistant vessels that allowed the Norse people to explore and navigate great distances between the eighth and eleventh centuries. Their narrow, elongated hull cut through the water with ease, and the combination of square sail and oars gave them maneuverability both in the open sea and in rivers and fjords.

These ships were true tools of travel: they were used for trade, fishing, war and exploration. Thanks to them, the Vikings reached the coasts of the North Atlantic, settled in places like Iceland and Greenland and even reached the shores of America centuries before Columbus. Their robustness and shallow draft allowed them to go inland along river courses, often surprising cities that believed they were safe away from the sea.

Visually, the Viking ship impresses with its effective simplicity. The bow and stern usually rise elegantly, and in many cases they were finished with carvings of animals or symbolic figures. On board, the crew was distributed on both sides to row in unison when the wind was not favorable, and the central mast supported a large wool sail, sometimes decorated with stripes or colors.

In Parque Europa, the recreation of the Viking ship allows you to imagine life on board: the creak of the wood, the rhythm of the oars and the wind filling the sail. It is a nod to the audacity of those northern sailors who made the sea their path. Contemplating this replica helps to understand how a seemingly simple boat changed the map of Europe and left an indelible mark on history and the collective imagination.
