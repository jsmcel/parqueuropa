Do you know what a tower is? It's like a very tall and narrow building. But this tower is very special because it is made of iron, like a metal giant!

The Eiffel Tower was built a long time ago, in 1889, more than one hundred and thirty years ago! It is very old, like your great-grandmother. It is made of wrought iron, which is a very resistant metal.

Do you know who made it? A very famous engineer named Gustave Eiffel, who was French. He was very good at building tall things!

The tower is very tall, measuring about three hundred and twenty-four meters, like a one hundred and eight-story building. What a giant! It has three levels that can be visited, and from above you can see all of Paris. It's like being in the clouds!

Do you know a curious thing? The Eiffel Tower has eighteen thousand thirty-eight pieces of iron joined together with two and a half million rivets. It's like a giant puzzle! And it weighs ten thousand one hundred tons, like ten thousand one hundred cars put together!

The Eiffel Tower is very famous because it is the symbol of Paris. Millions of people go to see it every year! It's like the city's mascot.

Do you know why it was built? For the Universal Exposition of 1889, which was like a very large fair where countries showed their inventions. It was to impress the world!

The Eiffel Tower teaches us that sometimes the highest things can be the most important. And it also reminds us that engineering and creativity can do incredible things.

Would you like to climb the Eiffel Tower? I'm sure you would be very excited! It's like climbing an iron giant.

So enjoy looking at this very special tower. Maybe it will inspire you to be more creative and build amazing things. Imagination has no limits!
