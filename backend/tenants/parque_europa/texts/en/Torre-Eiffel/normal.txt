The Eiffel Tower is the great emblem of Paris and one of the most recognizable monuments in the world. It was built on the occasion of the Universal Exposition of 1889 as a technical challenge and a sample of the potential of iron as a construction material. Its openwork structure, made of thousands of riveted pieces, draws a light and elegant figure in the sky.

At the time, the tower surprised and divided opinions: some considered it too bold for the city landscape. Over time, it won the affection of Parisians and travelers, until it became the undisputed symbol of the French capital. During the day, its changing geometry stands out depending on the perspective; At night, the lighting transforms it into an urban lighthouse.

Approaching the Eiffel Tower is to discover the precision of its design: arches that soften the base, intermediate platforms and a tip that seems to reach the clouds. It is a monument that combines engineering and beauty, where technique becomes art.

In Europa Park, the replica of the Eiffel Tower invites you to imagine the Champs de Mars and the bustle of the Seine. It is a perfect place for a photograph and to enjoy the magic of Paris in an up-close version. A romantic nod that puts a French finishing touch to the walk in the park.
