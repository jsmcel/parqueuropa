The Three Graces form a very special sculptural group that welcomes visitors to Parque Europa. They represent three young women embracing each other, and are a replica of a famous classical sculpture that symbolizes beauty, joy and harmony. These three figures come from Greco-Roman mythology: they were known as the Graces (or Charites, in Greek) and it was believed that they were goddesses in charge of presiding over festivals, banquets and all pleasant social events, spreading charm and good fortune. According to the most common version of the myth, they were daughters of Zeus (the king of the gods) and the nymph Eurynome, and their names – traditionally Aglae, Euphrosyne and Thalia – allude to the qualities they personified: Aglae means "the bright one" (resplendent beauty), Euphrosyne "the joyful" (joy and good cheer) and Thalia "the flourishing" (prosperity and abundance). Together, the Three Graces embody grace in its broadest sense: the charm, generosity and elegance that beautify life.

The original sculpture of the Three Graces has its origins in classical antiquity. Many artists of ancient Greece and Rome depicted this divine trio, usually showing the three young girls naked, standing and embracing in a circle. This composition allowed us to appreciate his figure from different angles and conveyed the idea of ​​inseparable unity. The most famous representation that has come down to us is a marble sculpture group that is currently exhibited in the Louvre Museum in Paris. That work, created more than two thousand years ago (probably in the late Hellenistic era, around the second century BC or the first century AD), shows the Three Graces as we see them here: two of them facing to the side and the one in the center with its body facing away from the audience, but turning its head towards the front. All three are sculpted with serene features and idealized bodies, reflecting the beauty canon of their time. With the passage of time, this sculpture was rediscovered in the seventeenth century in Italy and restored to recover the missing parts (heads and arms that had been lost). Since the 19th century it has been part of the Louvre collection, where it became one of the iconic pieces of classical statuary.

The Three Graces monument in Parque Europa is a faithful reproduction of that sculptural group at the Louvre, on a practically life-size scale. If we look closely, we see that the three young women are lightly leaning on each other in a gesture of trust and unity: their hands rest on the shoulders or backs of their companions, creating a scene of intimate friendship. In addition to aesthetics, there is deep symbolism in this image: the Graces always act together, representing that beauty, joy and generosity (that is, grace in all its forms) enhance each other and should be shared.

The choice of The Three Graces to welcome visitors to the park is not coincidental. Its presence at the beginning of the tour provides an elegant and positive air, as an omen that the visit will be full of good moments. Throughout history, this trio of goddesses has inspired numerous artists beyond classical sculpture: for example, the baroque painter Rubens portrayed them in a famous painting (today in the Prado Museum) and the neoclassical sculptor Antonio Canova made a much admired marble version in the 19th century. The image of the Three Graces has endured because its values ​​– shared beauty, the joy of life and generosity – are universal and timeless.

By contemplating this work in Parque Europa, we are connecting with that common cultural heritage. It is not necessary to know all the details of the myth to enjoy it: it is enough to appreciate the harmony of the forms, the expressiveness of that triple embrace and what it transmits to us. The Three Graces invite you to take a photo, but also to stop for a moment and think about the importance of friendship and the beautiful things that are enjoyed in company. In a park dedicated to bringing together emblematic monuments from various countries, they provide a classic and symbolic note, reminding us that Europe shares a timeless artistic legacy. Without a doubt, this sculpture is one of the highlights of the park due to its aesthetics and the history it represents, leaving a sweet and charming first impression on those who visit it.
