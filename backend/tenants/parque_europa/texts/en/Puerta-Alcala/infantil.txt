Hello, little explorers of Madrid! Today we are going to visit the Puerta de Alcalá, a very special monument that is in our own city, Madrid.

Do you know what a door is? It's like an entrance to a place. But this door is very special because it has no walls on the sides, it is alone in the middle of the street! It's like a giant bow.

The Puerta de Alcalá was built a long time ago, in 1778, more than two hundred and forty years ago! It is very old, like your great-grandmother. It is made of limestone, which is a very resistant stone.

Do you know who made it? A very famous architect called Francesco Sabatini, who was Italian but worked in Spain. He was very good at building pretty things!

The door has five arches: three large ones in the center and two small ones on the sides. It is as if it were a door with five entrances. How big! It is nineteen meters high, like a six-story building.

Do you know why it is called Puerta de Alcalá? Because it is on Alcalá street, which is one of the most important streets in Madrid. It's like the main street of the city!

The Puerta de Alcalá is very famous because it appears in a very beautiful song that many Spanish artists sing. He's like a music star! It also appears in many movies and series.

Do you know a curious thing? The door has two different faces. One side looks towards the center of Madrid and the other towards the east. It's like having two faces! Each face has different decorations.

The Puerta de Alcalá teaches us that sometimes the simplest things can be the most important. And it also reminds us that Madrid is a very special city with a lot of history.

Would you like to go under the Puerta de Alcalá? I'm sure you would be very excited! It's like passing through a triumphal arch.

So enjoy looking at this very special door. Maybe it will inspire you to learn more about the history of Madrid and to feel proud of your city. Madrid is very beautiful!
