The Puerta de Alcalá is one of the great emblems of Madrid. It stands in the Plaza de la Independencia as a monumental arch that welcomed those who arrived to the city along the old road to Alcalá. Its silhouette, with five openings and elegant decoration, announces the entrance to a modern and open capital.

Built in the eighteenth century by order of King Charles the Third, the work reflects the neoclassical taste of the time: clear lines, harmonious proportions and sober ornamentation with shields, garlands and allegorical figures. Over time, the Puerta de Alcalá has witnessed countless parades, celebrations and urban changes.

Today we see it surrounded by a large intersection and well-kept gardens. Its presence is integrated naturally into daily life, remembering that monumental beauty can coexist with the current rhythm of the city. It is also an emotional reference for Madrid residents and an essential place for visitors.

In Parque Europa, the replica of the Puerta de Alcalá reproduces its elegance and serenity. Stopping in front of it is like traveling, for a moment, to the heart of Madrid, and recognizing how a stone arch can become a symbol of identity and welcome.
